Logging feature for Ktor-Client

== Installation
[source,kotlin]
----
HttpClient {
    install(ClientLogging) {
        logFullUrl = true
        logHeaders = false
        logBody = false
        logger = ... // optionally your logger object
    }
}
----

== Experimental status
Logging for Ktor Client uses some experimental Ktor API and therefore unfortunately there is no
guarantee that there will no compatibility breaks between Ktor versions.

As a matter of fact, that's exactly what happened between versions `1.2` and `1.3`.

Keep that in mind.

== Ktor support
|===
| Ktor version | Ktor-Logging version

| 1.3 | >= 0.2
| 1.2 | \<= 0.1
